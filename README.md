# LEAVE! : A Pick your Story Adventure Game!
First collaborative coding project,

## Leave! short synopsis

 awn* “11 pm already..” you get up to get ready for your night shift work at a local convenient store. You take a shower, brush your teeth eat your dinner and say goodbye to your family and your dog you have had since you were 12. As a fresh grad 23 year old, you always knew that it was going to be hard finding a job. However, you never expected it to be so hard that you had to stay working at a convenient store for almost a year trying while also trying to find a stable job. This does not stop you though, you know to yourself you’ll get through this. 

As you reflect about life, you didn’t notice that you’ve reach the convenient store. You are greeted with by your co-worker at the cashier restocking shelves and the security guard sitting by the door playing his game to pass the time. “hey name, have you seen shelby anywhere?” your co-worker asks you. “ no, why?” you answer. “Did you not work with her during the night shift last night?” he asks. “no, it was my day-off, why what happened?” you answer. “apparently she didn’t go home and the parents are worried sick. I hope she’s okay tho, she’s only 26 ” he says. You brush it off as just one of those “run-away rebels” young adult normally do when they have freedom and money. 
Time passes and you’ve encountered many customers, just another normal boring night. *door opens*. You look to see a man in a full business attire and a eerie mask. However, you greet the man with a smile as he just stares at you then leaves. “what was that all about” you ask the guard. “Don’t worry name. He’s been coming very often, don’t be scared though I’m here to protect you”. “Thanks” you say. “Welp I’m gonna go smoke, I’ll be right back”. “Hey uhm name, can you do me a favor?” your co-worker asks. “What is it?” You ask. “Can you cover for me for an hour? My head is killing me”he asks. “Sure, go rest” you say.

Time goes by and it’s now 3 am.*ding* as the door opened, it was the same guy with the mask. He’s staring at you again, not moving an inch. “Good morning sir, how may I help you” you muttered frozen still and scared. You look around to see where the guard is and he is no where to be seen. *spray* he sprays something in your face as you pass out almost immediately.
